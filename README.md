# Modbus
https://adrianscheit.github.io/modbus/
## Goals: 
- simple low-lever serial Modbus toolset for most PC's (also MAC's), to easly debug a modbus network, 
- that everyone could possible use it without a need to install some dedicated software

Currently it is is only an "alpha" version.
Currently it is without a license.

### Done
- opening serial port
- simple sniffing functionality
- UInt16 registers decoding support
- float32 registers decoding support (limited)

### TODO
- add license
- sending frames
- full float32 support
- full float64 support???
- full Int16 support
- full Int32 support
- full UInt32 support
- full Int32 support
- slave mocks
- move the tests to a dedicated test framework like `jest`
- simple master??? maybe out of scope for this project
